//! What a project's agent may change.

//! Each tool is a thin wrapper over the verb the client calls: the same code
//! path, the same refusals, the same record afterwards. What the wrapper adds
//! is the scope. The project comes from the agent's owner binding and the
//! workspace is checked against it before anything runs, so a tool call cannot
//! reach a project this agent is not the agent of however it is spelled.
